Arduino muthithreading (Background thread and timer implementation)

This library is designed to be used in scenarios whee one foreground and one background thread is required
e.g. when part of the calculations are heavy and need to be done in background based on asynchronous fashion without
affecting the foreground processing working with gauges and communication
